# JEPA × FINO campaign log

**Goal:** maximize mean_probe_score. Beat the live Labless leader **jepa-mask25 = 0.6471** (I-JEPA contig-patch,
NimaAsh). Hypothesis: FINO metadata-guidance acts on the CLS token and is **orthogonal** to the JEPA patch
objective (DINO CLS + smooth-L1 latent regression + KDE), so it should *stack* — unlike on the DINO+iBOT base
where FINO's best (subtype+expr512) only reached 0.6351 (+0.0074 over 0.6277, below the +0.01 bar).

**Setup:** worktree `nanopath-jepafino` (branch `jepa-fino`), FINO cherry-picked onto `origin/leader`. JEPA
objective untouched; FINO grafted as a 4th loss term `meta` on the CLS token (GradScale DANN gate, EMA prototype
banks for discrete factors, MLP regressors for continuous, lambda_meta=0.03/branch). Smoke (job 81946) validated:
dino+jepa+kde+meta all flow, val + checkpoint(JEPA-predictor + FINO protos/predictors) OK. NOT submitting to labless.

Reference points (live board, same probe suite): leader **0.6471** (jepa family) · curation `lr-and-curation`
0.6357 · `dinov2-s-kde` 0.6277. FINO-on-DINO best: `abl_sub_expr512` 0.6351, `abl_subtype` 0.6323.

## Wave 1 (launched 2026-06-11 ~06:18, 4-wide, pinned n-1/3/4/8)
| id | job | recipe Δ vs JEPA leader (main.yaml) | M+ / M- | final | Δ vs 0.6471 | decision |
|----|-----|------------------------------------|---------|------:|------------:|----------|
| W1-base | 81947 | none — JEPA leader control (harness reproducibility) | — | running | — | — |
| W1-se   | 81948 | + FINO subtype + expr512 | subtype, expr512 M+ | running | — | — |
| W1-s    | 81949 | + FINO subtype | subtype M+ | running | — | — |
| W1-se-rr| 81950 | + FINO subtype + expr512, ramp:run | subtype, expr512 M+ | running | — | — |

Hypotheses: W1-base confirms we reproduce 0.6471 (control for all FINO deltas). W1-se = best DINO-era FINO lever
on JEPA. W1-s isolates the histotype anchor (most robust single factor in the DINO sweep). W1-se-rr tests the
run-keyed DANN ramp (nanopath is sample-capped at ~19% of FLOP budget; flop-keyed gamma stalls at ~0.74).
Results + Wave 2 design pending (~1 hr).

## Literature (scan 2026-06-11, ingested AdvDINO -> geist)
- **Novelty:** FINO M+/M- on a JEPA objective in pathology is novel. Precedents: AdvDINO (2508.04955, DANN on
  slide-ID atop DINOv2 — gate stacks, slide-ARI 0.663->0.037, survival +0.010); JEPA-T (2510.00974, metadata-
  conditioned JEPA predictor, T2I not pathology); GenBio-PathFM (JEPA as stage-2 on frozen DINO). None combine all.
- **JEPA framing:** "Pretext Matters" (2603.22649) — JEAs > JEPAs for spatially-localized signal (tile pathology);
  JEPA earns its keep only as an AUXILIARY on a DINO spine. Our leader recipe IS that shape -> keep DINO-CLS spine.
- **Weighting:** don't import lambda blindly (AdvDINO 50 vs FINO 0.03; magnitudes differ). GRADNORM-MATCH the meta
  branch to the SSL gradient. We log grad_norm -> use it. Wave-2 lever: sweep gamma_max / lambda_meta for JEPA.
- **Entanglement gotcha:** U(cancer|TSS)=1.0 -> solo TSS/scanner-M- reverses cancer signal; suppression must be
  PAIRED with an M+ anchor (subtype/cancer). Pure-suppression alone ~+0.01 (borderline). M+ anchor carries the EV.
- **Mechanism check:** for any M- run, measure slide/TSS-clustering ARI drop ("adversary working" signal) before
  expecting probe gains. **Novel idea (Wave 2/3):** condition JEPAPredictor on cancer-type embedding (JEPA-T style).

## Wave 2 candidate directions (finalize FROM Wave-1 results)
- if jf_sub_expr512 > jepa_base by >+0.01: push M+ stacking (subtype+expr512+morphology / +fga) + gamma_max sweep.
- if FINO ~flat on JEPA: gradnorm-match meta (raise gamma_max), OR try the JEPA-T metadata-conditioned predictor.
- paired cancer-M+/TSS-M- (entanglement-safe suppression) as a separate track once an M+ anchor is confirmed.
